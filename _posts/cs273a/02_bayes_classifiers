# Bayes Classifiers
* The most basic classifier: for each value of features, calculate the most likely
output
* Bayes rule: P(y|x) = P(x|y)*P(y) / P(x); Covariates are independent given "cause"
* Naive Bayes Gaussian models: for each features, the probability is Gaussian distribution
p(x_{1}) = frac{1}{Z}exp{-frac{1}{2\theta_{1}^2}(x_{1}-u_{1})^2}


# Bayes Classifiers: Measuring Error
* Bayes Error Rate: make optimal decision at any particular x; Error_rate = [1-maxc p(y=c|x)]

# Likelihood Ratio Tests
* Likelihood ratio: relative support for observation x under "alternative hypothesis" y=1,
compared to "null hypothesis" y = 0.
* Log likelihood ratio: log[p(x|y=1) / p(x|y=0)]

# Roc curves
* true positive rate (sensitivity) vs false positive rate (1 - specificity)
* AUC (area under the roc curve) can be used to measure the performance

# Gaussian Bayes Classifiers
