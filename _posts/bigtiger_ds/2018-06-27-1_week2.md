## Chi square test

1. Chi square distribution
  * sum of square of k standard normal random variable, N(0, 1)
  $$ X^2(k) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}Z_{i}^2 $$   


  * k-1 degree of freedom
  * Chi square test for one variance: H0: sample variance should equal population variance; there is an
  equation to calculate chi-square value based on n, population variance and available sample variance;
  this calculated value should be compared with critical value to decide whether to reject null hypothesis

2. Decide whether to reject null hypothesis
  * compare p value with type I error: if p value is smaller, reject
  * compare chi square statistic with critical value: if chi square statistic is larger, reject null hypothesis
  * Chi square test is always one sided test

3. What can Chi-square test be used for?
  * One sample test: the variable follows expected distribution (goodness of fit)
  * Two sample test: Ho: the two categorical variables are independent; Ha: the two categorical variables are related

4. Goodness of fit
  * Test if X follows certain distribution F, X is categorical var. H0: X follows F; Ha: X does not follow F   
  * Calculate chi-square statistics:
$$ chi-square = \sum_{all cells} \frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected} $$   
  * Use flip coin as an example; if get 10 tail and 0 head; df is 1 here   
$$ X^2 = \frac{(10 - 5)^2}{5} + \frac{(5 - 0)^2}{5} = 10 $$      

5. Two sample chi square test   
  * Test if X, Y follow the same distribution; H0: X and Y follow the same distribution; Ha: X and Y do not follow the same distribution    
  * Example: Two types of bidder, human and computer. Different categories
  of bidding product. Test computer bids similarly across
  categories as humans.  
    * Expected value X1 = col_sum1 * row_sum1 / (row_sum1 + row_sum2)
    * The observed O1 can be from either group (human or computer)
$$ chi-square = \sum_{all cells} \frac{(observed - expected)^2}{expected} $$        

## Simple linear regression  

1. Assumption   

2. Coefficient estimation    
How do we find optimal betas out of all the betas?    
  * Least square error estimation (LSE)   
  * Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
